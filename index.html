                                    <p>It is your job as a <abbr title="user interface / user experience">UI/UX</abbr> developer to first understand what a design problem is by being able to critically define it. Take note: this is where you define and evaluate the degree of solution for an app, software or program and the concepts upon which they run. It takes you out of the world of merely designing or creating but more of asking questions like: "Is this right or wrong?" "This page is beautiful but is it really necessary?" "This app works good but is it in the hands of the target?" "Did we design this app for the user or we designed it for ourselves?" These and more are the kind of questions a <abbr title="user interface / user experience">UI/UX</abbr> designer asks himself and his team. This holistic approach makes the idea to become clearer and in doing so, the designer can begin to make ruling on what seems necessary, what could be discarded and concepts or designs that could be improved upon.</p>

                                    <p>In many ways, being a <abbr title="user interface / user experience">UI/UX</abbr> designer takes you from the world of web designing and developing into the world of research and evaluation. A <abbr title="user interface / user experience">UI/UX</abbr> designer must understand that he has a role to play in keeping tabs with competitor analytical reports, making customer analysis and user research and tracking goals and marketing. In other words, he's also a part-marketer and -project manager as well. It is actually quite challenging because this discipline lies right in the middle of other disciplines; thus experience really helps. Because the projects he may take on could be very divergent. Evaluating the user experience of a restaurant application is quite different from a tech startup that does not even have a website let alone an app in the market. The underlying strengths of this discipline is that it tries to get it's target market, carry them along and provide optimum experience even if they have a form of disability or deprived one way or the other. First-rate communication skills, ability to empathise, versatility and some business know-how are a mainstay in attempting to understand the design problem.</p>

                                    <p>It's important to remember that without making clear definition, the work will lack focus and as a matter of fact, it will be difficult to share with your team members or convince stakeholders and even yourself, what exactly it is you are trying to achieve.</p>

                                            <h3>Conduct Preliminary Research</h3>

                                            <article class="content">

                                                <p>Conducting a preliminary research succeeds defining a clear problem statement. This is an immsersive, repeated process that identifies problems for which solutions are needed. It helps place users right at the center of your design process or your product. That's why it's termed "user-centric". The needs, behaviours, experience and motivation through necessary qualitative and quantitative means are explored. The types of user research you can or should perform will depend on the type of site, system or app you are developing, your timeline, and your environment.</p>
                                                <p>The conduction of preliminary research is to create designs that are truly relevant, to create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use, and to understand the return on investment of your user experience (UX) design. Preliminary research ideally involve surveys and formal experiments to measure the user behaviour in a way that can be statistically quanitified. It is advised that considerable time (but not too much) is spent at this stage because it is simply make-or-break, especially for much bigger projects.</p>
                                                <p>Conducting preliminary research may involve techniques like <strong>card sorting, focus groups and first click testing.</strong> Card sorting, at its heart, evaluates the information architecture of the site. People are made to organise topics into what they think make the most sense and label the groups as well. You simply ask the participants to pick and sort topics from your website into predefined categories. It's important not to overwhelm them. Actual pieces of paper can be used but an online software is not out of place. This is a great tool UI/UX designers employ and it is of immense benefit as it becomes glaring in an instant how the users expect the content to flow. You already begin to note what is likely very important to your user and should appear in certain sections of the site or app. What should go to the front page, how to label the categories and the navigation. It cuts down a great deal of assumption on the part of the designer.</p>
                                                <p>During this process, you could engage the participants in answering questions needed. Ensure you have as many sets of cards as concurrent sessions or have each participant at a separate computer if using online card-sorting software. You could also try to group them together and monitor the group dynamics. Some other things to consider are: randomise the order of presentation (if possible), let the users have an idea of the time estimate required for the card sort, consider using self-adhesive labels, let cards be neat and consistent; number the cards in the bottom corner or on the back, have blank cards available for participants to add topics and to name the groups they make when they sort the cards and also consider using a different coloured card for having participants name the groups.</p>
                                                <p>Also remember you may have to provide incentives for participants else they may be lethargic about feeding you with quality input or just become disillusioned halfway through the process. So show your gratitude or appreciation through a gift or payment you must have promised beforehand. And that is not all. You should give the participant a stack of different coloured cards. Ask the participant to use the coloured card to name each group. Ask what words the participant would expect to see on the homepage or second-level page that would lead the participant to that particular group of content items. You can put cards aside to indicate topics the participant would not want on the site.</p>
                                                <p>Let's assume you're done. These are a list of steps you want to take to transform your new powerful data into a better user-centric app. You should photograph the sort or use the numbers on the cards to quickly record what the participant did. Also snap or pen down the name the participants gave to each grouping and the numbers of the cards the participant included under that name. Then reorder the cards for the next session, if you have more participants. Consider which cards appeared together more frequently and how often they appeared in specific categories. Then telescope your findings in a report and share with your team and stakeholders. Now you have useful data for building a more relevant information architecture.</p>
                                                <p>On a final note, always remember not to overwhelm your participants with either too much cards or too much questions. If you have oversized options, it's your job to refine and limit them to an acceptable number that does not run into hours. Randomize the cards for every new session or bit-part sessions. Also note that sorting is more important than labeling. See to it to prioritise sorting in the event users are unsure or just simply unmotivated to label. Your experience and other design problem approaches would guide you.</p>

                                            <article class="content">                                                
                                                <p>The benefits of interviews are unique to, not just the webosphere but divers disciplines. There are 2 main things to consider when conducting interviewers: finding the right potential users and asking the right questions. Most startups or existing companies when creating new products or reviewing old ones, want to be resourceful. They do not want to be wasteful and need their marketing team (if they have one) along with you to identify the potential customer base. You want to know them better. They don't go aimless or just throw an app or product into the market then just see how it responds. They want to work with data and estimates, even if it makes for grim reading. It is agreed that the UI/UX designer is not exactly a marketing researcher or whatnot, but then his expertise covers this field too.</p>

                                                <p>That said, defining a target market helps in efficient utilization of your marketing and advertising resources and cannot be taken lightly. Also interviews can also be done online in this advanced technological age. Here's a list of factors to consider when attempting to conduct interviews:</p>

                                                <p>These interviews shed more light on how individuals think and feel about particular concepts of a business or mobile application and why they hold certain opinions. It also has an advantage in that some users may be unwilling to share certain information in focus groups. With interviews they may be more liberal and you can glean more detailed responses. Here as well, the tendency to be influenced by other members of a group is absent and ambiguities can be followed up by subsequent questions, especially for those who speak English as their second language. You should also be ready to quantify impersonal data. </p>

In the same vein, most women don't take particular interest in super fast automobiles and the really advanced ones are beyond the reach of most youth and students. Demographics helps you to define your target market.

However, you should not limit your business to a mass market(if you find it as a trend in most of your competitor brands), niche marketing is much more promising, so do have a look at your competitor's target market but analyse these niche markets that you can pitch to.

                                                <p>Brainstorming is the combination of informal problem solving and thinking. The technique intends for participants to come up with fresh ideas and methods; something that misses the eye. Some of these thoughts and ideas are crafted into original and creative solutions to problems, whereas help to spark additional ideas. All ideas engendered by brainstorming do not necessarily need to be implemented. The solution design problems could be broken down into phases and less rich ideas could be saved until later. Brainstorming does not have to start when the team is together. It should start individually before they group.</p>

                                                <p>Brainstorming done right can have profound results. It's more of art than science and it borders more on innovation and even eccentricity. It's usually done without any data, statistics or research to follow. It's also difficult to measure. Some project managers demand their designers to just think of anything at all, or think of absolutely ridiculous concepts or fields and try to relate them to the design problem at hand.</p>

Though the personal details of the persona may be semi-fiction, the information used to create the user type is not. The persona makes the <abbr title="user interface / user experience">UI/UX</abbr> designer model the ideal user for an application or software. User personas are extremely useful to grow and improve a business: they help uncover the different ways people search for, buy, and use products, so you can focus your efforts on improving the experience for real people and use cases.</p>
                                                <p>The user persona gives the designer a consistent reference before he veers of course in the project and start interpreting his own skewed perspective in milestones. The user persona also brings the whole team on the same page; there is no chance for unconscious dissidence. And if the app launch or marketing tweak is not successful, the user persona makes it easier to pinpoint flaws, and easily make adjustments.</p>

The designer has to go with both obtrusive ways like surveys, experiments, interviews, observation etc. and unobtrusive ways like document analysis, observation etc. The designer should begin the design process by listening to the end user. Overall, UX research helps us avoid our biases since we are required to design solutions for people who may have divergent behaviour. It takes practice and with practice comes more experience. The 5 steps of research are: Objectives, Hypotheses, Methods, Conduct and Synthesize.</p>

                                                <p>Exploring the current UX trends is never a bad idea. The use of rich sites like <a href="www.dribbble.com" rel="external">Dribbble</a> gives the UI/UX designer a clue on what is hot and likely right in the world of design. There are tons of unique content and materials out there that will definitely create a spark and let the user have a feel of what are modern trends. Websites of years 2006 to 2009 had a distinct look. Most background colours were flat with no alpha-transparency. Opacity was scarcely used and workarounds had to be largely done by Photoshop. Spooky flash animations were the in-thing. However with the advent of CSS3 and jQuery, opacity came on board, smoother transitions, accordions, tabs, sliders, carousels etc. As these trends metamorphosed from one epoch to another, wireframes, interfaces and prototypes also catered for them. Being innovative is good but your innovation should support you instead, not stand in the wave of modern trends. It will get crushed.</p>

                                                <p>The objectives of the market analysis section of a business plan are to show to investors that: you know your market the market is large enough to build a sustainable business. When assessing the size of the market, your approach will depend on the type of business you are selling to investors. If your business plan is for a small shop or a restaurant then you need to take a local approach and try to assess the market around your shop. If you are writing a business plan for a restaurant chain then you need to assess the market a national level. Depending on your market you might also want to slice it into different segments. This is especially relevant if you or your competitors focus only on certain segments.</p>

                                    <p>Wireframing is a method of designing a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are employed early enough in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added. It is an integral part of design solution and acts as a blueprint or roadmap, and provides a general overview of the development of the site. It provides the designer to see which elements go into a page, if the page or design aptly captures other steps of the design solutions without going the painstaking way of building the website and then adjusting for errors. It's quicker, it's easier (since it can be hand-drawn) but if they are to be usedd for a prototype test, then it may be required be built in HTML.</p>
                                    <p>One disadvantage though is that, as the wireframes do not include any design, or take into account technical implications, the concept may be unclear to the client or even the stakeholders. Hence, it is the designer's job to translate the wireframes into a design, so communication to support the wireframe is often needed to explain why page elements are positioned as they are. The designer must also have good oratory skills to get every stakeholder on the same page. Finally, when content is added, it might initially be too much to fit within the wireframe layout, so the designer and copywriter will need to work closely to make this fit.</p>

                                                <p>User testing is quite an important concept. This involves techniques used in the design process to evaluate a product, feature or prototype with real users. There are quite a number of reasons the UI/UX designer would decide to do this, chief being that it allows the design team to identify frictions in user experience they are designing, so solutions can be identified before being built or deployed. Identifying any issues early reduces the longer term cost and resources. It can be done in person but in the absence of that, it can also be done online. It's pertinent to know that it be done at any stage of the design process.</p>
                                                <p>User testing should ideally be performed on every project. Validation is vital to reducing risk. If the risk is substantially low it can be excused, but in almost every scenario some level of user testing will improve the process and reduce costs for the business.</p>

                                            <article class="content">                                                
                                                <p>At it's most basic level, this is simply the art of creating a full-sized functional model. These days, designers are spoilt for choice concerning which tools to use for prototyping. Frame, Marvel, Atomic, InVision, Pixate, Flint, Figma, Adobe XD ... you name it. Luckily, they are not so difficult to learn and they work in similar fashion, allowing designers to quickly add prototyping in multiple programs to their skillset. Prototype is the simulation of a final product and in our case, a design, app, software or website. It's like an interactive mockup that can have any degree of fidelity. The main purpose of building prototypes is to test whether or not the flow of the product is smooth and consistent. They allow designers to show their design through an interactive and engaging product, resulting in a better understanding of the design for everyone involved. Prototyping saves time and allows designers to quickly test out multiple ideas before committing to having developers write the codes to represent the design.</p>

                                                <p>They could be paper or click-through but let's face it: <em>these days the digital way is becoming more of the sine quan non</em>. From start to finish, prototyping is essential throughout all stages of the design process. There are 3 types of prototyping namely; low-fidelity, medium-fidelity and high-fidelity protoypes.
                                                Low fidelity in a way involve rough, almost diagrammatic sketches of the application covering essential elements that would appear on the webpage or on the site like images, buttons, links, text etc. It looks too simple but it rarely fails. Many designers do not like to go through all three processes. If they decide to go with two, I advise to at least not forego the low-fidelity for one simple reason. It's very clear what you want and what you do not want. All bells and whistles are absent and you focus more on the structure and relevance of the elements. Colours, pizzazz, click-through and even animations can be simulated on the other two types, so this one is the most distinct.</p>

                                                <p>After defining user flows and creating a mockup of the initial screens, it's time to link them together to create a clickable prototype that will look close to the intended final design. These don't have to be incredibly detailed, just enough to let the user get a feel for the final design while testing out the flows to see if they are clear and easy to understand. InVision is a great product for this stage of prototyping, as it allows designers to set hotspots on pages that can be clicked to proceed to the next stage of the flow without worrying about detailed animations.</p>

                                                <p>After user flows have been tried and tested, it's time to create and fine tune those beautiful animations to display to the development team - this is the high-fidelity stage. For these, designers need more control than simple transitions, so apps like Principle and Framer (if you know a bit of coding) are two good options to start with.</p>

                                    <p>Things so far have already begun to take shape. At this stage all ideas, wireframes, surveys, user personas, research, brainstorming results are consolidated. It must be said that this phase is more of the "UI" phase. For the most part, although complementing, the "UI" stage succeeds the "UX" stage. Now the look and feel part is addressed. Resources are gathered. A brand (or re-brand) is formed. All necessary images, the codes, responsiveness, element spacing and accessibility are reviewed. This stage also intermixes with graphic design and front-end web development too. Although there are grey areas that cut across many of these fields, for the most part, their peculiarity can be abstracted.</p>

                                                <p>This stage requires the UI designer to gather all relevant resources, either free or created. It is not always necessary to create things from scratch, for instance icons. There's a free ton of resources out there in the wild and sometimes, it may not be worth it to create new icons, graphics, images all from scratch. Only a few times in the UI designer's life would he be met with the demand of building a lot of these relevant resources from scratch. Nonetheless, the designer should be familiar with graphic tools like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. He could also edit free resources to his taste instead of starting things from scratch.</p>
                                                <p>This is not to play down the idea of building quality brand. Even if not creating from scratch, there are certain guidelines to building a brand for a company. The idea is to make end users to be able to easily identify with your product or app without even needing to read your name. The use of colours, icons, fonts, images and spacing should all merge in a way that conveys an identity.</p>

                                    <p>This stage deals majorly with writing both client- and server-side codes that make the app functional. It involves working closely with the developers. Best web development, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>, and accessibility practices must be implemented at this stage. The application must be user-friendly and responsive. Test for speed and correctness must be done as the codes are written. File naming convention must be right (no spaces, small leters, appropriate for the content) and consistent, right folder structures as well. The images must be named for SEO for example (yellow-concrete-stairs.jpg) and they must have the alt attribute. The -ARIA and WAI-ARIA roles need to find a way into the codebase. Title tags must be right, be found on every page, and be dynamic as well, relating richly to the content of the page.</p>
                                    <p>Heading structures should not overlap so as to assist users that make use of screen readers. External links should give an indication that they are what they are. Links also should be indicative of where it goes even before clicking. Spacing in the codebase should be consistent and then rounded off and minified, with technologies like gulp.js suitable enough to suffice. Sitemaps are critical and helps the search engine to parse the blueprint of the application / website.</p>

                                                <p>There has to be a synergy between the UI/UX designer and the backend developer. Minor design changes can still occur at this deep stage though but usually these changes are typically suggested by the developers from their own experience and know-how. Anyway, it is not one that usually significantly reshapens the scope of the project. Slight adjustments here and there and the application is already wrapped and ready to be launched to the outside world. The developers would make use of a host of exciting technologies to make the application come to life. Some management decide which programming languages to be used for their application. Most times, it moves with the trends or the ease and ubiquity of the language. At other times, the choice is entirely left to the developer team.</p>

Ideally, he would test for keyboard accessibility, right contrast, correct transitions and animations, and compatibility across different operating systems and user agents.</p>

Tricky sections of the application like sections that collect data input from users are rigorously tested and fed unbelievable input to double-check the reaction of the program.
